# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to understand how enterprise organizations process and analyze extremely large transactional datasets using high-performance data manipulation techniques in R.

This project implements an efficient in-memory data processing pipeline using the **data.table** package. Unlike traditional data.frame operations, data.table uses **reference semantics (pointer-level references)** to modify data directly in memory without creating unnecessary copies.

The project demonstrates high-speed data generation, importing, cleaning, filtering, indexing, aggregation, business analysis, and visualization of a large-scale sales transaction dataset containing **500,000 records**.

# Project Tasks Completed

## Task 1: Dataset Generation

- Generated a synthetic sales transaction dataset with 500,000 observations.
- Used random data generation techniques.
- Saved dataset as:

```
sales_transactions.csv
```

---

## Task 2: Dataset Import and Exploration

Performed:

- Dataset loading using `fread()`
- Displayed first and last observations
- Checked column names
- Verified data types
- Generated summary statistics
- Checked missing values
- Identified duplicate records
- Counted unique customers, products, and cities

---

## Task 3: Data Cleaning and Preparation

Performed:

- Removed duplicate records
- Converted data into correct formats
- Reordered columns
- Prepared dataset for analysis

---

## Task 4: High-Speed Data Manipulation

Implemented:

- Column selection
- Multiple column selection
- Single condition filtering
- Multiple condition filtering
- Ascending sorting
- Descending sorting
- Top 20 expensive products
- Top 20 highest quantity transactions

---

## Task 5: In-Place Column Updates using `:=`

Created new columns using data.table reference semantics.

Generated:

### Revenue

```
Quantity × UnitPrice
```

### Discount Amount

```
Revenue × Discount / 100
```

### GST Amount

```
Revenue × GST / 100
```

### Net Revenue

```
Revenue - DiscountAmount + GSTAmount
```

---

## Task 6: Indexing using setkey()

Implemented indexing for faster searching.

Created keys on:

- CustomerID
- ProductID

Performed indexed searches and compared execution efficiency.

---

## Task 7: Grouping and Aggregation

Generated business reports:

### Customer Summary

Includes:

- Total Orders
- Total Revenue
- Average Revenue


### Product Summary

Includes:

- Total Quantity Sold
- Total Revenue


### City Summary

Includes:

- Number of Transactions
- Total Revenue


### Category Summary

Includes:

- Total Revenue
- Average Revenue

---

# Business Analysis Performed

The following business questions were answered:

### 1. Which city generated the highest revenue?

Identified the city with maximum total revenue.

### 2. Which product generated maximum sales?

Found the highest-performing product.

### 3. Which customer placed the highest number of orders?

Identified the most active customer.

### 4. Which payment method is used most frequently?

Analyzed customer payment preferences.

### 5. What is the average transaction value?

Calculated average Net Revenue per transaction.

### 6. Which category generated maximum revenue?

Identified the best-performing product category.

### 7. Top 20 Customers by Revenue

Generated customer ranking based on revenue.

### 8. Top 20 Products by Quantity Sold

Generated product ranking based on sales quantity.

# Data Visualization

Generated visual reports using **Base R**.

The following plots were created:

## 1. Transactions by City
